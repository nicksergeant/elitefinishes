					Well as we all know, rock isn't very flexible. So once the liquids are dried out this causes the asphalt to crack and then things get worse. Water seeps into and through the asphalt, causing more and more decay. The result is that small cracks become large cracks, and eventually the surface needs to be repaired or, in extreme cases, replaced.
				</p>
				
				<div style="margin-top: 5px;">
					Areas which should be replaced:
					<ul>
						<li>Spider-webbed areas</li>
						<li>Areas that look like alligator skin</li>
						<li>Areas holding water</li>
						<li>Potholes</li>
					</ul>
					There are two techniques for replacing asphalt:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Overlay</b>: New hot asphalt placed directly over the existing asphalt, and then compacted.
								<ul>
									<li>Advantages: Cheaper and quicker</li>
									<li>Disadvantage: No solid edge to connect to, leaving it very vulnerable to damage during snow removal and reflective cracking (cracks pre-existing in the original asphalt developing cracks in the new asphalt)</li>
								</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>R.R.R. (Rip, Remove, Replace)</b>: Saw cutting, milling out or jack hammering the existing asphalt area to create a solid edge, then removing all broken asphalt to replace it with new hot asphalt and compacting it. (Recommended)
								<ul>
									<li>Advantage: Solid edge to butt together with existing asphalt, making it less vulnerable to snow removal problems. No reflective cracking due to existing asphalt removed.</li>
									<li>Disadvantage: More expensive than "overlay" and more time needed to complete the job.</li>
								</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
