					Asphalt is a petroleum based product. It is very flexible when it is first laid. As time passes, the petroleum based products (tar and bitumen) get oxidized and dry out by the sun. The asphalt becomes brittle when the surface color turns grey. It now has lost its flexibility and is going to crack. Cracks then lead to spider cracks looking like alligator skin. Cracks then lead to holes and deteriorated areas, then leading to asphalt replacement. This is why it is so important to seal asphalt.
				</p>

				<p>
					As everyone knows asphalt is very black when it is first applied, then over time, turns greyish in color. This graying process is called oxidization. The asphalt liquids have been cooked out leaving only dried out tar and bitumine. When an asphalt surface gets to this point it is time for it to be seal coated with a premium asphalt sealcoat product to protect the surface.
				</p>

				<p>
					Coal tar and asphalt emulsion petroleum sealers consist of oil, tar and bitumen. It has the same liquid ingredients as hot asphalt. It is also called "liquid asphalt".
				</p>

				<p>
					Being oil based, it is able to seep into the pores of the asphalt adding flexibility and protecting it against the natural elements (sun, rain, snow, ice, roots, etc.). This is called the 'asphalt rejuvenation process'.
				</p>

				<p>
					It repels the water from the surface and has a beading effect. This prevents water from penetrating small fissures and causing great damage. It creates a buffer against traffic and is resistant to oil, gasoline, salt and many other staining agents.
				</p>

				<p>
					Before you seal coat or repair any asphalt surface you need to prepare the surface properly. A key part of that process is making sure to remove any grease, oil, gas drips or leaks. Otherwise, the old grease, oil or gas will eat its way back up through the new sealcoat or repaired area.
				</p>

				<p>
					Elite Finishes will apply sealers to all edges by hand. This will reduce the chance of the sealer to stain any surrounding items.
