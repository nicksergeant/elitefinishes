					Companies are trying desperately to keep up with pavement cracks and pothole repairs. Prevention is much cheaper than repair. Research shows that active crack sealing programs are cost effective in extending the life of pavement as opposed to the cost of pavement repairs for areas left unsealed. Traditionally, crack sealing has been low on the priority list, both in terms of funding and time allotments. However, an effective crack sealing program is the single best weapon against pavement failure.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cracking is caused by thermal stresses or fatigue due to repeated traffic loading. The vast majority of potholes and pavement failures can be traced to water entering the base and sub-grade through joints that have not been crack sealed. In most pavements, the base, sub-base or sub-grade consist of a material that loses its load-carrying capacity when wet. Water enters through the cracks while traffic works and overloads the weakened areas, allowing more and more water to enter. This can cause potholes to develop rapidly and more severe pavement failures if left unsealed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ideal times to crack seal are in the spring and fall seasons, since the cooler temperatures cause pavement cracks to be open wider.
				</p>

				<p>
					Asphalt crack repair plays one of the most important factors to keeping an asphalt surface protected and maintained.  There are many different situations that require crack repair.
				</p>

				<p>
					In many situations cracks can be caused by poor foundation, by not having a thick enough or too thick of a layer of asphalt, earth movement, extremely heavy vehicles, roots from trees as well as the freeze-thaw cycle every year.
				</p>

				<p>
					As you can see, there are many factors that can affect an asphalt surface's deterioration. This is why asphalt maintenance is important.
				</p>

				<p>
					Other situations requiring asphalt crack repair may include longitudinal, transversal and diagonal cracks, edge cracks, reflective cracks, construction joint cracks, widening cracks, tree root cracks and edge or lane joint cracks.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is extremely important to repair any cracks that arise and maintain an ongoing asphalt crack repair maintenance program. Once water is allowed to enter the foundation, it will begin to erode, resulting in extensive and costly damage.
				</p>

				<p>
					Asphalt crack repair is a fast and easy process with little inconvenience.
